# Rust algorithms

This is a website with interactive visualizations of various sorting algorithms. The entire project is made in Rust, with a [Yew](https://yew.rs) frontend. This was created mainly for learning purposes, as I am trying to learn both Rust and different algorithms. For now there are only a few sorting algorithms, but I may also dive into path-finding algorithms at some point.

Below is an image of the website with a bar graph of a randomly generated input. You can go through the steps that the algorithm takes to sort the input by using the slider.

The implementations of the algorithms can be found at [/src/sorting_algorithms](/src/sorting_algorithms). Their descriptions are rendered on the website as well.
