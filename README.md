# Rust algorithms

This is a website with interactive visualizations of various sorting algorithms. The entire project is made in Rust, with a [Yew](https://yew.rs) frontend. This was created mainly for learning purposes, as I am trying to learn both Rust and different algorithms. For now there are only some sorting algorithms, but I may also add some path-finding algorithms at some point.

Below is an image of the website with a randomly generated (but customized) input list of numbers and the sorted output. The bar graph visualizes the graph in steps. You can go through the steps that the algorithm takes to sort the input by using the slider.

The implementations of the algorithms can be found at [/src/sorting_algorithms](/src/sorting_algorithms)
