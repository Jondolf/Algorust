# Bubble sort

*Bubble sort*, also referred to as *sinking sort*, iterates through the list, comparing adjacent elements. If the elements are in the wrong order, it swaps them.

Bubble sort is very simple, so it's a great introduction to sorting algorithms, but it does not generally perform well for sorting lists in real world use. More efficient algorithms like quicksort or merge sort should usually be used instead.

One advantage of bubble sort is that it can be used to efficiently check if the list is already sorted. It also out-performs many other algorithms in cases where the list is mostly sorted.

## Performance

| Case             | Complexity |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Average          | O(n²)      |
| Worst-case       | O(n²)      |
| Best-case        | O(n)       |
| Space complexity | O(1)       |
